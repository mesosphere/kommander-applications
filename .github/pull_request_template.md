**If the PR adds a version bump, does it add a breaking change in License**:
<!--
For example, If a chart changes license from say Apache License to GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE then
that would have legal repercussions (as we ship helm charts, image bundles for airgapped etc.,) and multiple
parties (Like Product, Legal for example) need to be notified when such a change happens.
-->

- [ ] No License Change (or NA).
