# kommander-applications

This repo is dedicated to storing the HelmRelease and other info needed for Kommander's Applications.
### Pre Commit
This repo uses https://pre-commit.com/ to run pre-commit hooks. Please install pre-commit and run `pre-commit install` in the root directory before committing.

### Running Tests

You can run tests with `make go-test`. If your tests do not meet a certain coverage threshold, your build will fail.

### App Image Licenses

This repo contains a list of images, `licenses.d2iq.yaml` used to keep licenses up-to-date. This list is comprised of two sections: `ignore` and `resources`. `ignore` is a list of images that should be ignored when validating the license mappings.

Due to the automation of image version bumping, the original comments were unable to be retained and are listed below by corresponding image:
