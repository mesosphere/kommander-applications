# This HelmRelease is added here to so that Kommander CLI will have something to reference when building
# a chart bundle to be uploaded to chart musuem.
# When a user runs `dkp create chart-bundle` and points to `kommander-applications` repository, CLI looks at all
# yaml files with `HelmRelease` in them to check which charts needs to be downloaded for the repository.
#
# After moving the chart from kommander repository to mesosphere/charts repository, we needed a way to be able to download
# a chart without having to create a new ClusterApp in `applications` directory. Hence, this file is populated here
# solely for the purposes of
#  1) CI tooling to build a complete airgapped bundle and 2)
#  2) Ensure cert federation chart is downloaded when a user runs `dkp create chart-bundle`.
