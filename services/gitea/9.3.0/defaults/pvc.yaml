# In the previous versions (v8.x and prior), PVC was automatically managed by the Statefulset, while in the
# new versions (v9.x and later), it is automatically handled by the Helm chart.
# In order to remain backward compatible with previous installations, we manually create a PVC object,
# filling in its name value with the data-gitea-0 that is the value in gitea v8.x and older versions.
