  # TODO(mh): The `kube-oidc-proxy` depends on `cert-manager` which is installed
  # on attached clusters with default AppDeployemnts.
  # Right now the controller that is creating the `kube-oidc-proxy` AppDeployment
  # for attached cluster is depending on Traefik being deployed, so this is used
  # as a sync mechanism. It should be updated in future and add an explicit
  # dependency.
  # The dependency is not added yet because it would break default installation
  # into management cluster ns.
  # JIRA: https://jira.d2iq.com/browse/D2IQ-78147
