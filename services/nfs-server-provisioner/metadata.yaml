  # Overview
  NFS Server Provisioner is an out-of-tree dynamic provisioner for Kubernetes. You can use it to quickly & easily deploy
  shared storage that works almost anywhere.

  This chart will deploy the Kubernetes external-storage projects nfs provisioner.
  This provisioner includes a built in NFS server, and is not intended for connecting to a pre-existing NFS server.
  If you have a pre-existing NFS Server, please consider using the NFS Client Provisioner instead.
