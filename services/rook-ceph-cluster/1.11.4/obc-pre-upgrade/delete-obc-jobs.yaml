# For upgrades from DKP <2.6 to 2.6.x.
# **REMOVE THIS AFTER 2.6 IS RELEASED**
# Delete the Jobs created by the OBC chart prior to upgrading. We added priority class
# support to Job specs, which is an immutable field and requires the Job to be
# deleted and recreated. After this release, we can remove this pre-upgrade step because
# TTL will be set on the Job to automatically clean it up after it runs.
# Select all OBC jobs by using the label "helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=object-bucket-claims".
# The job will also be run pre-install but will be a noop.
# It will also get run during upgrades within 2.6, but recreating the job will not have any effects.
