            # - Replication:
            #   - Smallest possible replicas count is 2 for HA. count: 3 is more commonly used.
            #   - With replication of size: 2, we store 2 copies of data and this tolerates loss of one copy of data.
            #   - 50% Storage efficiency in this scenario with fault tolerance of 1 out 4 nodes (loss in number of storage nodes hosts or OSDs).
            # - ErasureCoded:
            #   - Slices an object into k data fragments and computes m parity fragments.
            #   - The k + m = n fragments are spread across n Storage Nodes to provide data protection.
            #   - At least k out of n fragments (could be parity or could be data fragments) are needed for recreation of data. This means we can afford to lose at most m fragments.
            #   - Smallest possible count is k = 2, m = 1 i.e., n = k + m = 3. Works only if there are at least n = 3 storage nodes (hosts or OSDs).
            #   - Storage overhead is m / k percentage.
            #   - Example configurations: (NKP docs recommend that a cluster has at least a 4 nodes):
            #     - With 3 data chunks and 1 parity chunks (which is what shipped in 2.3.x with MinIO), we can afford to lose up to 1 chunk. 1/3 = 33% Storage overhead and fault tolerance of 1 out of 4 nodes.
            #     - With 6 data chunks and 2 parity chunks its same as above but this needs 8 OSDs (NKP Cluster need not have 8 nodes - Each node can have more than 1 OSD).
